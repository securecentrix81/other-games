   <pre>Game Overview<br>You play as Saharsh, a student whose goal is to fail as many classes as possible by ignoring schoolwork and playing games on "Secure Centrix".<br><br>How to Play<br>Movement: Use WASD or Arrow Keys to run around the school arena.<br>Goal: Collect the Green Laptops (Secure Centrix Terminals). Collecting enough of them fills your "Distraction Meter" and causes you to Fail a Class (which increases your Score).<br>Obstacles: Avoid Red Books (Homework) and Grey Teachers.<br>Irony Alert: In this game, Health is your GPA.<br>If you hit obstacles, you "learn" and your GPA goes UP.<br>If your GPA hits 4.0, you Graduate (Game Over).<br>Keep your GPA as low as possible (0.0) to survive!<br>Features<br>3D Graphics: Built with Three.js.<br>Custom Character: Saharsh is rendered using the specific texture provided.<br>Ironic Mechanics: A "reverse health" system where getting good grades kills you.<br>Dynamic Difficulty: More enemies spawn as you fail more classes.<br>Open the index.html file in your browser to start failing classes!</pre>
   <h2><a href="gemini-3.0-pro-1.html">Gemini 3.0 Pro (again)</a></h2>

They actively chase you.<br>Health System: Your health is your GPA. It starts at 4.0. Getting hit drops it by 0.5.

   <pre>Created a full single-page 3D action-puzzle adventure using Three.js: built HUD, menus, overlays, controls, and a multi-level Secure Centrix classroom arena featuring Saharsh with GPA/timer systems, collectible assignments, ordered hacking nodes, roaming drones, terminal uploads, and polished UI interactions.</pre>
   <h2><a href="gpt-5.1-high.html">GPT 5.1 High</a></h2>
   <pre>GAME OVERVIEW<br>You play as Saharsh in a 3D classroom arena. Each “class” is a level. Your goal is to keep his grade above 60% by the end of each class while being tempted by SecureCentrix.<br><br>Green cubes = homework/assignments (raise grade).<br>Blue glowing pillars = SecureCentrix terminals (increase fun but lower grade).<br><br>There are 3 classes in a semester: Math, Science, and History. After each class you see a result screen, and at the end you get a full semester report based on how many classes you passed and how much SecureCentrix fun you had.<br><br>CONTROLS<br>- Move: WASD or Arrow Keys<br>- Pause / Resume: P<br><br>GAMEPLAY<br>- From the main menu, click “Start Semester”.<br>- You’ll be dropped into a 3D classroom space.<br>- Move around to:<br>  - Collect green assignment cubes: each one adds to your grade (up to 100%).<br>  - Touch blue SecureCentrix pillars: each hit increases your SecureCentrix fun but drops your grade.<br>- Time counts down for each class (shown in the top HUD).<br>- When the timer hits 0:<br>  - If grade ≥ 60%: you pass the class.<br>  - If grade &lt; 60%: you fail the class.<br>- After a class finishes, a mid-screen report shows your result and gives you a chance to go to the next class or to the final semester report.<br>- At the very end, the “Semester Report” shows:<br>  - How many classes you passed/failed.<br>  - Total SecureCentrix fun.<br>  - A summary message based on your performance.<br><br>HUD / UI<br>- Top left:<br>  - Current class name.<br>  - Time left in seconds.<br>  - Grade percentage and a color-coded grade bar:<br>    - Green = strong grade.<br>    - Yellow = passing but risky.<br>    - Red = failing range.<br>  - SecureCentrix fun score (total hits on terminals).<br>  - Classes passed so far (out of 3).<br>- Pause banner appears at the top if you press P while in a class.<br>- Menu, between-class panel, and final report are all overlay panels that don’t interrupt or break the 3D scene.<br><br>WIN / LOSE FEEL<br>- Passing at least most of the classes with a lot of SecureCentrix fun gives you a “Survived the semester” feel.<br>- Failing most or all classes gives you harsher messages about SecureCentrix taking over.<br><br>To play, save the first code block as an `.html` file (for example: `saharsh-secure-centrix81.html`) and open it in any modern browser with internet access (for the three.js CDN).</pre>
