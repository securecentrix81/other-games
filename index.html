Collect 5 assignment cubes (blue) to improve your grade and win. Avoid red spinners (distractions) that reduce HP and lower grades. Flip yellow switches (press E near them) to open doors or change the environment.<br><br>HUD<br>- Top-left shows current Grade, HP, and progress bar.  <br>- Bottom center shows how many assignments you've collected out of 5.<br><br>Win / Lose<br>- Collect all 5 assignments to win (Semester Passed).  <br>- If HP drops to 0, you fail (Semester Failed).<br><br>Prototype notes (what was simplified)<br>- The user requested a 3D action-puzzle-adventure about playing as Saharash failing classes and using SecureCentrix. That concept is large for a single-file deliverable, so this is a functional prototype capturing the spirit:<br>  - 3D world built with three.js in a single HTML file.<br>  - Avatar uses the provided portrait as a billboard sprite to represent Saharash.<br>  - Core mechanics included: movement, jumping, collectibles (assignments), hazards (distractions), switches that open a door, simple grade and HP system.<br>  - No network, accounts, or real secure platform integration (only a themed scene named Secure Centrix81). No persistent saving, advanced AI enemies, or large open-world features due to single-file constraints.<br><br>If you want<br>- More levels, animated 3D character model, physics-based puzzles (matter.js), or more sophisticated enemies, tell me which feature to expand and I will produce an updated single-file prototype focused on that area.<br></pre>

     <pre>I’ve created a complete single-page HTML game called “Be A Failure or Asian IQ Brain-minded” in index.html. It includes Tailwind UI, a canvas-based game, IQ evolution system, and escalating Centrix boss fights, all in one file.<br><br>Here’s how it works and how to play:<br><br>How to run<br>Download the index.html file.<br>Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).<br>The game loads immediately; no server or extra libraries needed.<br>Core Game Loop<br>The game has distinct states:<br><br>Menu<br><br>Shows a styled title screen inside the canvas.<br>Press the “Start New Run” button to begin at 0 IQ.<br>Study Phase (IQ Farming)<br><br>Top HUD shows:<br>IQ (0 → 450)<br>Form (your current evolution)<br>Phase (Study phase / Boss fight / etc.)<br>Stage (how many 50-IQ blocks you’ve passed, from 0 to 9)<br>Inside the arena:<br>You control a glowing square “brain avatar” with IQ number above its head.<br>Green boxes (“HW”) are homework: +1 IQ.<br>Blue boxes (“T”) are tutors: +3 IQ (rarer, risk–reward).<br>Items spawn around the map; collect them to increase IQ.<br>Whenever you cross the next multiple of 50 IQ (50, 100, 150, ...), you unlock a Centrix boss.<br>Once you reach that threshold, the game switches into a boss fight.<br>Boss Phase (Centrix Fights)<br><br>Boss stage index is tied to your IQ:<br>At 50 IQ → Boss 1<br>100 IQ → Boss 2<br>...<br>450 IQ → Boss 9 (Final Ultra Centrix)<br>Each boss:<br>Has higher HP.<br>Fires more bullets / denser patterns.<br>Spawns faster and tougher goons that chase you.<br>Non-final bosses (Boss 1–8)<br>You get a Study Blaster:<br>Fire with Spacebar or by holding left mouse button / tap on the canvas.<br>Your shots fly upwards and damage Centrix and can kill goons.<br>Centrix attacks with:<br>Red bullet waves (vertical curtains, then radial patterns as bosses get stronger).<br>Orange goons that home in on your position.<br>One hit from a bullet or a goon = instant fail, full reset.<br>Final Boss (450 IQ – Ultra Centrix)<br>You do not get the Study Blaster.<br>Instead:<br>Ultra Centrix fires brutal bullet patterns and spawns goons.<br>Your raw IQ passively drains the boss HP over time (an “IQ aura”).<br>Your only job is to dodge everything long enough for the boss HP to hit zero.<br>Game Over<br><br>If anything hits you during any phase:<br>You immediately go to Game Over state.<br>Your IQ is set back to 0.<br>A panel explains why you died and confirms: “Your IQ has been reset all the way back to 0. Start over and try again.”<br>Click “Start from 0 IQ” to begin a new full run.<br>There are no checkpoints; every mistake restarts from 0 IQ exactly as requested.<br>Victory<br><br>If you survive and drain Ultra Centrix’s HP:<br>Game goes to Victory state.<br>A panel says you reached the ultimate IQ form and beat the final boss.<br>Your IQ is set to 450.<br>You can click “Play Again from 0 IQ” to attempt another run.<br>Controls<br>Movement<br>W / A / S / D or Arrow keys.<br>Shooting (Boss 1–8 only)<br>Spacebar.<br>Or hold Left Mouse Button on the canvas.<br>Or tap and hold on mobile.<br>Pause / Resume<br>Use the Pause button in the top HUD (switches between “Pause” and “Resume”).<br>Movement is analog (diagonals are normalized so you don’t move faster diagonal). The player is kept inside the arena with a small margin.<br><br>IQ Forms / Evolution<br>The IQ bar goes from 0 to 450. As your IQ increases, your “form” label in the HUD updates:<br><br>0 IQ — Saharsh — Casual Gamer<br>50 IQ — Hamster on a Wheel<br>100 IQ — Curious Toddler<br>150 IQ — Anbu — Determined Learner<br>200 IQ — Calvin — Code Tinkerer<br>250 IQ — Dedicated Teacher<br>300 IQ — Elite Student<br>350 IQ — Respected Professor<br>400 IQ — Legendary Scientist<br>450 IQ — World-Class Doctor<br>Each multiple of 50 IQ both:<br><br>Evolves your shown form.<br>Unlocks a tougher Centrix boss.<br>Boss Scaling & Difficulty Feel<br>HP scaling: Each new boss level has more HP.<br>Bullet patterns:<br>Early bosses use simpler downward bullet waves.<br>Higher bosses add more rows and more bullets per wave.<br>Later bosses switch to radial “bullet hell” rings that spin based on time.<br>Goons:<br>Spawn from screen edges.<br>Move directly towards you.<br>Number, speed, and spawn rate all increase with boss index.<br>Player Blaster cooldown:<br>Slightly faster for higher bosses (so you feel more powerful) but still balanced by the bullet and goon spam.<br>Final boss:<br>No shooting; HP falls over time based on a set damage rate.<br>Difficulty comes from heavy bullet patterns + goon pressure.<br>UI / Polish<br>Tailwind-based layout:<br>Main game card with canvas.<br>Side information panels for “How to Play”, “IQ Forms”, and “Centrix Boss Hints”.<br>HUD:<br>Shows IQ, Form, Phase, and Stage.<br>Status text above the canvas:<br>Updates live: Menu, Study Phase instructions, Boss instructions, Final Boss note, Game Over, Victory.<br>Floating banner:<br>Nice glassy notification at the top of the arena appears for short tips:<br>e.g., “Study Phase: collect homework (green) and tutors (blue)!”<br>e.g., “Boss X: Centrix vs [Your Form]! Use your Study Blaster.”<br>e.g., “Final Boss: Ultra Centrix! Dodge everything while your IQ does the damage.”<br>State panel:<br>For Game Over and Victory, a bottom panel appears with explanation and a single main button to restart.<br>What you can tweak (if you want)<br>All game logic is in the &lt;script&gt; tag:<br><br>Item values & spawn rates:<br>Change homework/tutor IQ values or spawn timer for faster or slower runs.<br>Boss difficulty:<br>Adjust bullet speeds, counts, and goon limits to make it easier or more “bullet‑hell”.<br>Player speed:<br>Change player.speed if you want snappier or heavier movement.<br>Damage rate in final boss:<br>Tweak the auraDamageRate to make the Ultra Centrix fight longer/shorter.<br>If you want, I can next:<br><br>Add a run timer and “best run” tracking (client-side only).<br>Add simple sound effects (HTML5 Audio) for pickups, shots, and hits.<br>Add small visual icons for each IQ form in a side timeline.</pre>
