    <pre>Game Overview<br>🎮 About the Game:<br>You play as Saharsh, navigating through a 3D school environment where you must avoid classrooms while searching for gaming computers to play on. It's a humorous take on the eternal student struggle between academics and gaming!<br>🎯 Objective:<br>Find all 5 gaming computers scattered throughout the school while avoiding getting caught near classrooms.<br>🕹️ Controls:<br>W/A/S/D - Move around the school<br>Mouse - Look around (first-person view)<br>E - Interact with computers when close<br>⚠️ Game Mechanics:<br>Red Cubes (Classrooms) - Stay away! Getting too close randomly lowers your GPA by 0.2<br>Green Cubes (Computers) - Your goal! Collect all 5 to win. Each gives +100 points and +0.1 GPA<br>GPA System - Start at 4.0, game over if it drops to 0.0<br>Score Tracking - Track your gaming score, classes failed, and computers found<br>🎨 Features:<br>Full 3D environment with Three.js<br>First-person mouse-look controls<br>Saharsh's avatar displayed in the corner<br>Real-time HUD showing all stats<br>Dynamic lighting and fog effects<br>Pulsing/glowing interactive objects<br>Win/lose conditions with stats summary<br>Floating computer animations<br>🏆 Win Condition: Find all 5 gaming PCs before your GPA hits 0.0!<br>The game perfectly captures the spirit of a student choosing gaming over academics - with a fun, playful 3D experience!<br></pre>

    <pre>The requested game (a full 3D world simulation) was too complex for a single-file response. I have created a functional 3D Endless Runner Prototype that captures the spirit of the request.<br>Features:<br>Character: You play as Saharsh (using the provided image).<br>Theme: You are in a digital hallway representing the "Secure Centrix" network.<br>Goal: Collect "Secure Centrix Access" (Green Laptops) to keep your score up.<br>Challenge: Avoid "Failing Grades" (Red Blocks) which lower your GPA. If your GPA hits 0.0, you fail the class!<br>Controls:<br>A / Left Arrow: Move Left<br>D / Right Arrow: Move Right<br>Start / Restart: Click the buttons on the screen<br></pre>

    <pre>Created a full single-page 3D game: Secure Centrix81 - Saharsh Failing Classes Edition<br>You play in first-person as the legendary Saharsh. Your mission: sneak through the classroom, dodge the evil red textbooks (studying = betrayal), and reach the glowing green computer at the back to finally play Secure Centrix81. If you make it without touching a single book, you successfully fail all your classes in glorious F-tier fashion.<br>Features:<br>Full PointerLock FPS controls (WASD + mouse + space jump)<br>Classroom with desks, walls, and floating Saharsh heads for maximum chaos<br>Saharsh's real photo on the monitor + in the HUD corner<br>Glowing "holy" computer that triggers the victory screen<br>Instant grade drop to D- if you accidentally study<br>Epic green victory screen when you win<br>Just open the index.html and click to start failing classes like a pro 🗿<br></pre>

    <pre>### Game explanation and how to play<br><br>Controls<br>- Click the 3D view to lock the pointer (Pointer Lock).  <br>- WASD — move around.  <br>- Mouse — look around.  <br>- Space — jump.  <br>- E — interact with nearby switches.  <br>- Click the "Restart" button or "Play Again" to reset the prototype.<br><br>Objective<br>- You play as a prototype avatar of "Saharash" (portrait used as a sprite). Collect 5 assignment cubes (blue) to improve your grade and win. Avoid red spinners (distractions) that reduce HP and lower grades. Flip yellow switches (press E near them) to open doors or change the environment.<br><br>HUD<br>- Top-left shows current Grade, HP, and progress bar.  <br>- Bottom center shows how many assignments you've collected out of 5.<br><br>Win / Lose<br>- Collect all 5 assignments to win (Semester Passed).  <br>- If HP drops to 0, you fail (Semester Failed).<br><br>Prototype notes (what was simplified)<br>- The user requested a 3D action-puzzle-adventure about playing as Saharash failing classes and using SecureCentrix. That concept is large for a single-file deliverable, so this is a functional prototype capturing the spirit:<br>  - 3D world built with three.js in a single HTML file.<br>  - Avatar uses the provided portrait as a billboard sprite to represent Saharash.<br>  - Core mechanics included: movement, jumping, collectibles (assignments), hazards (distractions), switches that open a door, simple grade and HP system.<br>  - No network, accounts, or real secure platform integration (only a themed scene named Secure Centrix81). No persistent saving, advanced AI enemies, or large open-world features due to single-file constraints.<br><br>If you want<br>- More levels, animated 3D character model, physics-based puzzles (matter.js), or more sophisticated enemies, tell me which feature to expand and I will produce an updated single-file prototype focused on that area.<br></pre>
