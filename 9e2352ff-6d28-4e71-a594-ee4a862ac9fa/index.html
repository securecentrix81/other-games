    <pre>Saharsh Life: School Survival<br>I have created a fully functional school survival RPG where you play as Saharsh. The game runs in a single HTML file with no external dependencies other than Tailwind CSS and fonts.<br><br>How to Play<br>Goal: Survive from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM without failing out or having a mental breakdown.<br>Movement: Use WASD or Arrow Keys.<br>Classes: Stand in the labeled "Class" zones to raise your Grades. However, this is boring, so your Sanity will drop.<br>SecurCentrix: Hold SPACE anywhere to play the mobile game "SecurCentrix". This rapidly restores Sanity but causes your Grades to drop (especially fast if a Teacher sees you!).<br>Annoying People: Press E near other students (gray dots) to annoy them. This earns you Clout (Score) and restores a small amount of Sanity.<br>Bullies: Avoid the Red dots! They will chase you, damage your Sanity, and lower your Grades.<br>Features<br>Custom Character: Uses the specified image for Saharsh.<br>Dynamic Stats: Balance your GPA vs. Sanity.<br>NPC AI: Bullies chase, Teachers patrol, Students wander.<br>Minigame Overlay: Visual feedback when playing SecurCentrix.<br>Win/Loss States: Complete the school day to win.<br>Open the file in any modern browser to play</pre>

    <pre>Game Overview<br>You play as Saharsh during a single hectic school day.<br>Your goal is to keep three stats above zero for the entire day and finish with a good balance:<br><br>Grades<br>Fun<br>Social<br>The school day lasts 180 seconds. If time reaches 0, you either:<br><br>Win with a “You Made It!” victory screen if:<br>Grades ≥ 70<br>Fun ≥ 35<br>Social ≥ 35<br>Or get a “Day Over” summary explaining what went off-balance.<br>If any stat hits 0 before the timer ends, the day ends immediately with an explanation and a retry option.<br><br>Controls<br>Move: WASD or Arrow Keys<br>Interact (hold): E<br>Pause / Unpause: P<br>Restart (after day ends): R or the on-screen button<br>Movement is top-down: you control a glowing blue circle (Saharsh) walking around the school.<br><br>The Map & Zones<br>The school is shown in a top-down layout on the canvas.
